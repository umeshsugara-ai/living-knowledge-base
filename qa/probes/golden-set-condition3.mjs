// qa/probes/golden-set-condition3.mjs — T-021 condition 3.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `qa/gates/golden-set-redesign.md` (Option C) makes condition 3 a PRECONDITION on
// reporting a recall number: the two leakage diagnostics "must be re-run on any regenerated set
// BEFORE its recall number is reported" (`scripts/lib/golden-set-diagnostics.mjs` header, verbatim).
//
// They were run — on a 75-question set that scored recall@5 0.307. THE OPERATIVE SET IS A DIFFERENT
// ONE: `data/eval/golden-set.json` holds 92 questions generated 2026-09-08T09:01 (kept 92,
// rejected 0), and all three current reports score against it — heuristic 0.391, vector 0.935,
// hybrid 0.870. `scripts/gen-golden-set.mjs` writes the set and the reject list and nothing else,
// and no file under `data/eval/` contains a pin rate. So three recall numbers, including one this
// maker shipped and cited in a PASSed unit, rest on a set whose leakage was never measured.
//
// READ-ONLY and offline: pure functions over files already on disk. No model, no network, no
// writes outside the report path — so the checker can reproduce it exactly.
//
// Run: node qa/probes/golden-set-condition3.mjs [--write]
