// qa/probes/golden-set-ambiguity.mjs — T-021, the sibling-session ambiguity half of condition 4.
//
// WHAT THE GATE RECORDS. `qa/gates/golden-set-redesign.md`: "An independent read of 12 questions
// found ~4 genuinely answerable by more than one session, driven by seven identically-formatted
// `uniaccess-*` sessions — e.g. *'is the university in the city or a secluded campus?'* is answered
// by all of them." 12 of 92 read by hand, and condition 4 is blocked on it.
//
// WHAT THIS MEASURES. "Genuinely answerable by more than one session" is SEMANTIC and no
// deterministic script decides it. What is measurable is LEXICAL NON-DISCRIMINATION: whether a
// question's distinguishing vocabulary sits in the target's transcript any more than in its
// siblings'. A proxy in BOTH directions — a session can share the vocabulary without answering, and
// answer without sharing it.
//
// CYCLE 2 — four defects the cycle-1 checker found, all of them in this file:
//
//   ISS-234  The known positive was pinned to the WRONG QUESTION. `gq01` is "support for students
//            looking for internships"; the gate's example is `gq02`, "city or a secluded campus?".
//            The shipped JSON carried gq01's id and text under gq02's justification, so the
//            contradiction was already on disk. Worse, gq01 ranked 21 not because siblings answer
//            it but because its own transcript lacks `support` and `looking` — it passed for an
//            unrelated reason, which is the accidental known-positive this test exists to prevent.
//            Now pinned to gq02, and the result is reported WHATEVER it turns out to be.
//
//   ISS-235  `coverage()` had no length normalisation, so short transcripts scored low on every
//            question and their questions floated to the tail: 6 of 13 came from the two shortest
//            sessions. Each session's own mean coverage is now subtracted, so what is ranked is a
//            session's advantage on THIS question against its own baseline.
//
//   ISS-236  `1/df` is not IDF. It floors at 1/23, so four words present in all 23 sessions still
//            carried 36% of the weight mass — the generic vocabulary a stopword list exists to
//            suppress was not being suppressed. Now `log(N/df)`, which reaches exactly zero at
//            df = N. The cycle-1 claim that this replaced a stopword list was therefore wrong.
//
//   ISS-237  The cluster claim was argued from the binary statistic this same file calls unusable,
//            and it REVERSES on the usable one. Restated from rank below.
//
// READ-ONLY, offline, pure over files already on disk.
