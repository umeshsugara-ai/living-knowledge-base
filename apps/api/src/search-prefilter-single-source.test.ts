/**
 * apps/api/src/search-prefilter-single-source.test.ts — ISS-074.
 *
 * `search-prefilter-coverage` closed the DERIVATION class: change how `buildTurnPrefilter`
 * derives tokens and `search-prefilter.test.ts` reddens. It did not close the BYPASS class — a
 * checker deleted the delegation in `search-store.ts`, hand-rolled a defective filter inline, and
 * typecheck plus 96/96 plus 59/59 all stayed green. The extraction had MOVED the untested
 * boundary rather than removed it.
 *
 * `createMongoSearchDeps` calls `turnsColl()` with no injectable handle, so its query cannot be
 * pinned by exercising real behaviour without a live Mongo. This is the same source-text
 * regression pin `tree-index-root-filter-single-source.test.ts` already uses for the same reason,
 * and it carries the same deliberate narrowness: it proves the specific defect (the shipping file
 * building its own filter again) cannot reappear silently. It does not prove the query is correct
 * in general — `buildTurnPrefilter` itself is exercised with real assertions in
 * `search-prefilter.test.ts`, and end-to-end parity is verified live against real Mongo per unit.
