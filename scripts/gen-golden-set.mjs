/**
 * scripts/gen-golden-set.mjs — regenerates `data/eval/golden-set.json` under the ANSWERED gate
 * `qa/gates/golden-set-redesign.md` (Option C, approved by Umesh 2026-09-08).
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. The previous version was five lines of the form `question: insight` — it lifted
 * a verbatim `keyInsights` string out of `session_page.json` and called it a question. Retrieval
 * then scored that string against the `summary` field of *the same document*: same author, same
 * pass, same rare named entities. recall@5 came out 1.000 with zero misses, which is not a good
 * score but an unfalsifiable one (ISS-071) — it could register a regression and could never
 * demonstrate an improvement, leaving Phase 1's exit criteria unfailable.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD, per the gate's four binding conditions:
 *   - generates from the RAW TRANSCRIPT (`turns.json`), never `session_page.json`;
 *   - uses a DIFFERENT MODEL from the summarizer and a different prompt. The summarize jobKind
 *     resolves to Gemini's DEFAULT_MODEL `gemini-2.5-flash`, so `session_page.json` came from
 *     Flash and this generates with `gemini-2.5-pro` (Umesh, 2026-09-08). Literally a different
 *     model, but the SAME vendor and family — see the disclosure at the provider construction;
 *   - asks for questions a student would actually ask, not declarative excerpts;
 *   - names NEAR-NEIGHBOUR sessions (chosen for shared topic vocabulary) in the prompt and
 *     requires wording that would also fit them, so a single globally-unique token cannot pin
 *     the answer.
 *
 * The prompt REQUESTS those properties; a deterministic post-filter ENFORCES them — every
 * candidate is rejected if it is pinned by a token unique to its own session or overlaps the
 * transcript verbatim. That split is deliberate: the model is asked for judgment, and code
 * decides what ships. A prompt alone would have produced a set nobody could vouch for.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT, and the gate says so too: Option C reduces but does not remove same-source
 * vocabulary leakage. The questions still come from the same transcripts the retriever indexes.
 * It is the weakest of the three options on independence and was chosen on cost/latency.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/gen-golden-set.mjs [--dry-run] [--per-session N]
 *   --dry-run          build prompts and report the neighbour selection; make no API call.
 *   --provenance-only  rewrite golden-set-provenance.json from the set already on disk; no API call.
 *   --refilter         re-apply the CURRENT filter to the candidates already on disk; no API call.

Hard requirements:
1. Phrase each as an actual question someone would type or say. Never a declarative statement or
   a summary sentence.
2. Do NOT quote the transcript. Use your own wording throughout.
3. AVOID rare identifying words — company names, product names, unusual numbers, and any term a
   different session would be unlikely to mention. The question must NOT be answerable just by
   spotting one distinctive word.
4. Write questions whose WORDING would also plausibly fit these related sessions, so that only
   understanding the content — not keyword-spotting — identifies the right one:
${neighbourTitles.map((t) => `     - ${t}`).join("\n")}
5. Each question must still be genuinely answerable from THIS transcript.
