 * TWO conditions, and the first one is the fix for ISS-093. The original criterion was "unique in
 * the corpus retrieval scores" — the `session_page` text. That corpus is **3,099 words across all
 * 23 sessions**, roughly 135 words each, and at that size ordinary words land in exactly one
 * summary BY CHANCE and register as rare. Measured: `should`, `will`, `you`, `people`, `paths`,
 * `skills`, `living` were all "page-unique", and **13 of 17 rejections fired on words like those**
 * — the filter was discarding good questions for containing "should".
 *
 * Uniqueness is now computed over the **turns** corpus: 217,980 words, ~70× larger, where a token
 * appearing in exactly one session is genuinely rare rather than a sampling artefact. Verified on
 * the same words: none are turns-unique, while `flywire` — an actual brand name — is unique in
 * both.
 *
 * The second condition survives unchanged from the original design, and is still right: a rare
 * word is only a *shortcut* if the retriever can see it, so it must also appear in the target's
 * page text. Dropping it would reject questions over words that cannot influence retrieval at all.
