/**
 * scripts/lib/golden-set-diagnostics.mjs — the two leakage diagnostics the golden-set gate
 * (qa/gates/golden-set-redesign.md, Option C, condition 3) requires be re-run on any regenerated
 * set BEFORE its recall number is reported.
 *
 * WHY THESE TWO. `data/eval/golden-set.json` scored recall@5 = 1.000 with zero misses, which is
 * not a good result — it is an unfalsifiable one (ISS-071). The cause was structural: each
 * question was a verbatim `keyInsights` string lifted from the SAME `session_page.json` document
 * whose `summary` field retrieval then scores against. Same author, same pass, same rare named
 * entities. A recall number produced that way measures copy-detection, not retrieval.
 *
 * So a regenerated set needs two independent checks, because they fail in opposite directions:
 *
 *   1. VERBATIM OVERLAP — is the question literally a span of the target's own text? If yes, the
 *      eval is a string-matching tautology. Must stay ~0.
 *   2. UNIQUE-TOKEN PIN RATE — can a SINGLE token that occurs in exactly one session pin the
 *      answer? A question can be fully paraphrased (overlap 0) and still be trivial because it
 *      names "Flywire" and only one session ever says "Flywire". Measured at 63% on the leaky
 *      set; the gate requires "well below" that.
 *
 * Check 2 is the one that matters, and it is the one a paraphrasing fix does not fix. Both are
 * pure functions over data already on disk — no model, no network — so the checker can reproduce
 * them exactly.
