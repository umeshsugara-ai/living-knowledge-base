/**
 * scripts/lib/catalogue.mjs — machine signals + scoring for the feature catalogue (plan §10 U0.5).
 *
 * The whole point is that a verdict is DERIVED, not asserted. Four signals, all read off the real
 * repo/deployment rather than anyone's opinion:
 *   routes      — scraped from the route files under apps/api/src/routes, minus stubs.ts's 501 list
 *   collections — real document counts from the newest `qa/evidence/live-<stamp>` preflight.json
 *   pages       — scraped from apps/web/src/App.tsx's Route path entries
 *   packages    — reachability: is @lkb/<name> imported by anything outside its own package?
 *
 * A `manual` entry in catalogue.json may only LOWER a verdict. An attempted upgrade is refused
 * loudly rather than silently honoured — otherwise the score becomes self-congratulation again.
