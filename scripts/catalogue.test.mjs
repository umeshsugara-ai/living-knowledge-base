/**
 * scripts/catalogue.test.mjs — regression cover for the progress scorer's honesty guards
 * (plan §10 U0.5, ISS-030). Every one of these was proven by hand once and then had NO test, so a
 * later refactor could have silently deleted the guard and the score would have gone back to
 * being self-assessment. Each case below is an ATTACK on the score, not a happy path.
 *
 * Covers: (a) a manual upgrade is refused; (b) a lowering is honoured; (c) an unknown verdict
 * string cannot slip past the ordering check; (d) dropping a feature to shrink the denominator is
 * refused; (e) scoring is deterministic; (f) the probe fingerprint changes when a probe is edited.
 * CLI-level behaviour (exit statuses of the real command) lives in catalogue-cli.test.mjs.
 * Run: node --test scripts/catalogue.test.mjs
