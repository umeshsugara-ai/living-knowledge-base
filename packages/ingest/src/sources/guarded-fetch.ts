/**
 * packages/ingest/src/sources/guarded-fetch.ts — a `UrlFetcher` that refuses to reach inside the
 * network. ISS-C-UNRUN-WRITERS-002 (high); contract invariant [I3] of watched-sources-entrypoint.
 *
 * Watched Sources fetches a stored URL on a timer, unattended, from inside the perimeter. That is
 * a textbook SSRF surface, and the cycle-1 checker ruled on where the control belongs and why:
 *
 *   NOT at registration. A store-time hostname check cannot survive DNS rebinding -- a name that
 *   resolved to a public address when a user registered it can resolve to 169.254.169.254 by the
 *   time the timer fires. Blocking a literal metadata IP in the route would LOOK like a control
 *   while leaving the actual path open, which is worse than having none.
 *
 * So the check is here, on the RESOLVED ADDRESSES, immediately before each request, and every
 * redirect hop is re-resolved and re-checked. `lookup` and `request` are injected so the whole
 * thing is testable without a network.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT (ISS-C-UNRUN-WRITERS-007). An earlier version of this comment claimed "the
 * resolution the guard checks is the same one the caller will use". **That was false**, and an
 * overclaim in a security docstring is worse than the gap it papers over: `request` takes a URL and
 * re-resolves independently, so a check->connect window remains that only connect-time address
 * pinning closes. What this module does guarantee is that EVERY address the resolver returns is
 * checked, so a host publishing one public and one private record cannot win a coin flip. Closing
 * the remaining window needs a transport that accepts a pinned address.
 *
 * It fails CLOSED throughout: an address that cannot be parsed is treated as blocked, because the
 * alternative is a parser disagreement becoming an exfiltration path.
 */
