/**
 * packages/ingest/src/source.ts — T-020 C1. The one `Source` adapter interface every adapter
 * under `sources/*.ts` implements, plus the `ConsentContext` shape and the D-008 provided-first
 * soft-gate helper (contract `qa/contracts/ingestion-source-seam.md` C1, C5). `SourceDoc` /
 * `MediaDoc` / `TurnDoc` are re-exports of T-018's generated `Sources` / `Media` / `Turns` types
 * (schema/{sources,media,turns}.schema.json) — never redeclared here.
 *
 * `toTurns()` on every adapter produces the *pre-persistence* turn shape — text + timing, no
 * `_id`/`tenantId`/`sessionId` yet, since the ingest pipeline (not this seam) assigns those on
 * write. That shape already exists as `Turn` in `packages/ai/src/stt/transcribe.ts` ("matches
 * schema/turns.schema.json minus the ids the caller fills in") — the exact seam the `recording`
 * adapter delegates to (C2). Reusing it here (rather than declaring a second near-identical
 * "pre-id turn" type) is what "no re-declared shapes" means in practice for `Turn`; `TurnDoc`
 * is kept alongside as the full persisted-doc alias for callers that need it.
