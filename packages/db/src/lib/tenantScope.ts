// packages/db/src/lib/tenantScope.ts — T-018 C6. One shared definition of the
// tenant-scoping accessor pattern (ARCHITECTURE §5: "no handler accepts a tenant id from
// the client — session/auth-derived only"; every knowledge-layer row carries tenantId).
//
// scopedCollection(db, name) returns a function whose signature FORCES a tenantId argument
// at every call site — `coll(tenantId).find(filter)` — so a tenant-less query is a TS
// compile error, not a runtime bug. Every packages/db/src/collections/<coll>.ts file
// wraps this once; it is the only place the tenant-scoping logic itself is written.
