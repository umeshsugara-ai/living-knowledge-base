 * packages/index/src/search/lexical.ts — plan §10 U0.7 (second half). Real lexical retrieval
 * over `turns` — the un-stub for `GET /search`, and the seam plan §10 U1.5's later hybrid merge
 * is meant to reuse ("the hybrid merge reuses this lexical scorer").
 *
 * Same bag-of-words tokenize+overlap technique already used three times in this codebase
 * (`apps/api/src/score.ts`'s `heuristicScore`, `packages/index/src/eval/heuristic-retriever.ts`,
 * `packages/index/src/tree/extract-topics.ts`'s heuristic extractor) — reusing the established,
 * dependency-free pattern rather than introducing a fourth, DIFFERENT scoring approach (BM25,
 * embeddings) for what the plan itself calls a starting "lexical" implementation. A genuine
 * refactor to a single shared `tokenize`/`overlap` util is a real candidate for a later cleanup
 * unit, but out of scope here — this unit's job is un-stubbing the route, not a cross-cutting
 * dedup pass touching three other files' established behavior.

 * The query's tokens, using the SAME tokenizer `lexicalSearchTurns` scores with.
 *
 * Exported so a datastore can pre-filter candidates server-side instead of shipping every turn
 * to Node (measured 2026-09-08 against real data: fetching all 2118 turns costs ~1064ms while
 * scoring them costs ~38ms — the cost is transfer, not computation).
 *
 * Sharing one tokenizer is what makes that pre-filter safe. `lexicalSearchTurns` gives a turn a
 * non-zero score only if at least one of THESE tokens is present as a whole token, so a filter
 * that keeps every turn containing any of them as a SUBSTRING is a guaranteed superset of the
 * scoring set — substring matching is strictly more permissive than whole-token matching. Extra
 * turns the filter lets through simply score 0 and are dropped. If a caller derived its own token
 * list instead, that guarantee would be a coincidence rather than a property: verified against
 * real data that dropping short tokens (a `length > 2` filter) silently turned a 10-hit result
 * for "AI in counselling" into 2, and reduced "is it ok to go" to no tokens at all.
