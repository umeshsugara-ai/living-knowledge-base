/**
 * packages/index/src/pipeline/speaker-docs.ts — U2.4 apply step, the PURE half.
 *
 * Everything upstream of this file could only ever REFUSE to name someone. This one writes
 * identities down, so its failure mode is different in kind: it can assert that two different
 * human beings are the same person.
 *
 * That risk is concrete and was carried here as a blocking item from three checker cycles.
 * `personId` is derived from the spoken name (`personIdFor` in `speakers.ts`), so two people
 * legitimately called "Ruby" in different sessions produce the same id. No amount of pattern work
 * upstream fixes that — it is an identity question, not a text question.
 *
 * The rule this module adopts: **merge, but never silently.**
 *   - Same session, same name -> one person. Diarization splitting one voice across `spk:N` labels
 *     is the common case, and treating those as two people would be the worse error.
 *   - Different sessions, same name -> merged into one document, but recorded as a COLLISION and
 *     the document's confidence is lowered. A caller cannot report a clean write over an
 *     ambiguous one, because the collisions come back alongside the docs.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do: decide that two same-named speakers are different people. There
 * is no evidence in the corpus that could settle it, and inventing a disambiguator ("person:ruby-2")
 * would fabricate a distinction as confidently as merging fabricates an identity.

/**
 * The subset of the tenant-scoped accessor this write is allowed to use.

 * Named explicitly rather than typed as the whole accessor, because that is the guard. ISS-102:
 * the first version of this logic lived in `scripts/sync-speakers.mjs` and called `replaceOne`,
 * which `scopedCollection` does not expose — `raw` was removed under ISS-065 — so the live write
 * threw `TypeError` on its first document and the "separately approved step" could not run at all.
 *
 * It survived review because every `tsconfig.json` is `include: ["src/**\/*.ts"]`, leaving `.mjs`
 * entrypoints outside `pnpm -r typecheck` entirely, and nothing exercised the non-dry-run branch.
 * That is the third recurrence of one shape (ISS-060, ISS-065, ISS-068), so the remedy is
 * structural: the logic lives in typechecked source and the entrypoint only wires it up. Reaching
 * for a method that is not on this interface is now a compile error.
